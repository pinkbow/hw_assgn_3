Additional Comments:

- Great job! You're really getting the hang of this. Good attention to detail in terms of spacing, sizes, and colors. Your HTML is well formatted and your CSS class and ID names are consistant and descriptive.

- You can use pseudo classes to apply state-specific styling to elements. These are things like "a:hover" to create a style for anchor tags only when the user puts their mouse over the link, or "a:visited" to create a style only for links that have been visited by the user.
